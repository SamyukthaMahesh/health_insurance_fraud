# health_insurance_fraud

The dataset is taken from 
https://www.kaggle.com/rohitrox/healthcare-provider-fraud-detection-analysis


Out of the files from the dataset,  only the train files are used for this project.  

Our goal is to save as much as money as possible.

For this Project, all the four Datasets and the Juypter Notebook need to be in the same folder.

Rename the following files as such: <br>
	1. Train_Beneficiarydata-1542865627584.csv to BeneficiaryData.csv <br>
	2. Train_Inpatientdata-1542865627584 to InpatientData.csv <br>
	3. Train_Outpatientdata-1542865627584 to OutpatientData.csv <br>
	4. Train-1542865627584 to ProviderData.csv


Tableau_final.twb  has the exploration done via tableau.<br>
The file for tableau is the excel sheet named  " Fraud Detection Data"<br>
